# About me
I'm a young French Software Engineer, currently working at [Mobeye](http://www.mobeye-app.com/).

## Studies
I've been passionate about computers since I was a little kid. At the age of 9, I started
writing my own programs in QuickBasic on an old Windows 3.11 computer.

I always kept practicing on my free time, and self-taught myself a few languages (VB6,
VB.Net, PHP, C#, Javascript...)

### Engineering School
When it was time to choose my career path, there was no hesitation that I wanted to become
a software developer. Since I felt I needed a more formal education in order to learn the
best practices, I enrolled at the **[Institut Sup√©rieur d'Electronique de Paris](http://www.isep.fr/)**
(also known as ISEP), a French top engineering school located in the heart of Paris.

I graduated at the end of 2013, and was honored to be my promotion's **valedictorian**.

### Stanford
I was lucky to be able to go to Stanford as a **Visiting Student Researcher**, where I
worked in Evan Reed's [Materials Computation and Theory Group](https://web.stanford.edu/group/evanreed/)
where I analyzed material physics simulation results using machine learning and graph
algorithms.

I also followed several courses there, which was awesome and allowed me to increase my
Computer Science knowledge.

### Online
I've been following online courses (also knwon as MOOC) for a few years now. I started on
**Udacity** and am now following a few more on **Coursera**.

## Hobbies
I'm not just a developper! I also enjoy a few hobbies

* **Reading** has been my passion since I knew how to! I'm particularly fond of the Fantasy
and Science Fiction genres, but I've also been reading other things when they caught my
attention (looking at you, Ken Follett!)

* Watching **series** is also nice! I'm currently a fan of *South Park*, *Game of Thrones*,
*Sherlock* as well as *Rick and Morty*. (I also watch *Adventure Time* but shh, it's a
secret!)

* **Sports**? I'm generally not a fan, but I like a few of them: Hiking, Skiing and Biking
for instance!

* I really love *traveling*! It's a passion for me, I try to visit everything I can,
including in Paris!
Here's a list of places I visited:
