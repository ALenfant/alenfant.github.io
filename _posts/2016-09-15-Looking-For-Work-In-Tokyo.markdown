# Looking for work in Tokyo, Japan

I'm currently looking for a 1-year Software Engineer contract starting from end of January/start of February in Tokyo, Japan.

A French Volontariat International Ã  l'Etranger (VIE) would be a big plus but I'm open to the right opportunity.

Please contact me if you have any leads!
